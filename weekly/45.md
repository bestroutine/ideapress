Understanding Shared Libraries in Linux

https://www.tecmint.com/understanding-shared-libraries-in-linux/

Linux supports two classes of libraries, namely:

- **Static libraries**– are bound to a program statically at compile time.
- **Dynamic or shared libraries**– are loaded when a program is launched and loaded into memory and binding occurs at run time.

Shared libraries are loaded by **ld.so**

ld - The GNU linker

To get a list of all shared library dependencies for a binary file, you can use the**ldd utility**.
